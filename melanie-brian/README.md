# Project Name

**Author**: Melanie Cohen & Brian Bixby
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
<!-- We are building a blog app so that users can filter articles by both category and author via dropdown. We also built in functionality for 'read more' and 'read less'. -->

## Getting Started
<!-- The user must first fork this repository. Once the repo is forked, the user must clone their new repo onto their machine. From there, the user can open the site using the index.html or using live-server.-->


## Architecture
<!--  We used Javascript, HTML & CSS, using Normalize to reset the browser settings and Iconomoon for icons. The CSS files are sectioned into three sections: base, layout, modules, and state. The JS files include blogArticles.js (with the raw data), article.js (which instantiates objects and pushes them to the DOM), and blogArticles (which filters data according to category or author). -->

## Change Log
<!-- 01-11-2018 1:00pm - Application successfully filters based on cateogry and author. Read more and read less functionality is also working.

## Credits and Collaborations
<!-- Normalize CSS reset and Iconomoon. -->
