#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Brian and Melanie paired together. It took about 4-4.5**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started on index.html and added the script links
  2. Next, we worked on article.js and updated the .toHTML() method
  3. Next, we tackled the articleView.js page. We reviewed the necessary items to begin and added concatenation where indicated.
  4. Next, we added functionality to manage the author and category filters.
  5. We then used event delegation for the handleCategoryFilter, handleMainNav, and setTeaser functions.
  6. Finally, we called all functions.
