Overview
The user of the app what be able specific selection(s) base on the article's title and catagory.

Getting Started
We first followed the setup instructions for github and our local machiines. We then read through the original "starter-code" to get an idea of what we are going to be working on. We talked about each 'TODO' before starting to code.

Architecture
The assignment is to creat new functionalities on a one-page blog app. We added options for users to filter for different blog(s) based on the author name and the article category. Technologies used: jQuery library to (select and manipulate) different functions of the app.
