03-jquery-events

**Author**: Josh Fredrickson & Ken Unterseher
**Version**: 1.0.13 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This assignment was to help us understand event binding, event delegation, and effects

## Getting Started
The user must create a seperate data file of blog posts. From here they would create a template in HTML. Next they would create JQuery events to bind events, and use delegation for finding elements to be added.

## Architecture
This was designed using Git Hub for version control, HTML for the markup for the document, CSS to style the document, Java Script to create the magic! JQuery was used to access, traverse, and manipulate the DOM.
