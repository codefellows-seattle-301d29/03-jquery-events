## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

We first followed the setup instructions for github and our local machiines.
We then read through the original "starter-code" to get an idea of what we are going to be working on. 
We talked about each 'TODO' before starting to code. 

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

The assignment is to creat new functionalities on a one-page blog app. 
We added options for users to filter for different blog(s) based on the author name and the article category.
Technologies used: jQuery library to (select and manipulate) different functions of the app.

Some shallenges:

> Getting the manu buttons to work and they stared to work only after we add a call funtions at the very end of the article.js page.
