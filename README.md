## User Stories and Feature Tasks

- Continue styling the app using SMACSS practices. Take a few minutes for code review of your partner's CSS and decide how to incorporate it into your paired lab. You can choose one partner's CSS structure, or you can combine them as you see fit. Seek to optimize and organize your CSS as much as possible!

*As a user, I want to be able to filter my articles so that I can selectively view articles by author or by category.*

- Complete the new requirements for setting `data-<attributes>` in your `toHtml()` method.
- Complete the methods for handling filter events when selecting an option from a drop down menu via Authors and Categories so that only the selected articles are displayed on the screen.

*As a user, I want to be able to preview each article so that I can easily view the results and select the one I want to read further.*

- Add an event to reveal a complete article if the user would like to see more of it beyond the teaser.

*As a user, I want tab-based navigation so that I can easily visit other sections of my site.*

- Complete the method `articleView.handleMainNav()` for implementing tab-based event navigation on the page.

*As a developer, I want my code to be thoughtfully organized, easy to read, and executing efficiently.*

- Review and understand the new JS file, `articleView.js`
- Add any new script tags to your HTML.
- Refactor concatenation using template literals.
- Render the app upon page load.

### Stretch Goal

*As a user, I want to be able to collapse an expanded article to the teaser view so that I can more easily scan over a series of articles.*

- Build in functionality such that a user can click on "Show Less" to collapse a full article into a teaser.

# Project Name

**Author**: Your Name Goes Here
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

<!-- We have built this application to learn about using jQuery filters and event delegation. -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

<!-- First they would have to set up the filters for categories and authors. Then they would have to setup the controls for the main navigation to show and hide itself. -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

<!-- We had to use event delegations, template literals, and filters. We used jQuery for our library. We also used specific selectors such as nth-of-type. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-11-2018 9:00am: Started with the filters
01-11-2018 10:00am: Filters working and started on hiding the articles.
01-11-2018 12:00am: Articles hidden. Started on working on nav buttons home/about hiding.
01-11-2018 1:30:00am: Finished project. Sendig it in. Pushing up to master then to canvas
```
